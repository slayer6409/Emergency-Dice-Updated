<h1>Other Stuff</h1>

<h2>Custom Events</h2>
<p>In the config there is an option to make custom events. Currently, you can make:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Enemy events</strong>: Spawns whatever quantity of selected enemy, either inside or outside.</li>
    <li><strong>Trap events</strong>: Spawns however many traps of whatever you select — you can make them move too.</li>
    <li><strong>Item events</strong>: Spawns whatever item you want with whatever quantity you want.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Brutal</h2>
<p>There is a Brutal Company–style config that allows for dice effects to be triggered either randomly or at the beginning of the day.</p>

<h2>April Fools</h2>
<p>April Fools mode in the config makes dice float, increases spawn weights, and hides which dice you roll — for example, a Saint die might secretly be a Sacrificer.</p>

<h2>Debug Menu</h2>
<p>If you're the host of the lobby (and you have the debug menu/button enabled in the config), there's a robust debug menu for triggering dice effects, teleporting, reviving, spawning things, and more. The default keybind is <strong>Numpad -</strong>, but this can be changed in the settings.</p>
